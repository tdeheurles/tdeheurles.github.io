After a few moment looking at some solutions (jekyll, jekyll-Bootstrap), I found a very easy and quick one named [Jekyll-Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/). It's especially detailed in this [blog post from SmashingMagazine](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

I won't repeat this post because it's exactly what you need to create an easy blog hosted on Github for free.

**Some details :**

- It's free
- You just have to fork a repository and you can start writing your articles
- You use only markdown ...
- ... but you can add HTML if you want
- don't need to install anything
